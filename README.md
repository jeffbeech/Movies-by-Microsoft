## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to analyze the trends in the movie industry to discover ways for Microsoft to break into the industry and stand out amongst its well-established competitors. We analyzed the top 100 films between 2008 and 2018, their production budgets, return on investment, the most consistently profitable genres and the comparative review of domestic and worldwide data.

## Data
The datasets of this project are from the following websites:
 - Box Office Mojo
 - IMDB
 - The Numbers

## Methods
We performed exploratory data analysis with visualizations to better understand the different information from the datasets. We restricted the data to an eleven year period (2008-2018).
We had several questions that we wanted to explore to improve the accuracy of our results:
 - What are the top 100 films by gross returns over the time period? What are their genres? If we aggregate, what are the three most common genres? Who directed them?
 - Are the relative profits of big budget movies higher or lower than low budget movies? Are the relative profits of one category more dispersed than the other categories?

## Results
### What budget levels are profitable?
It would be tempting to look at the list of “top 100 movies by profit” and base our entire analysis off of that. However, we think a potentially much more important metric than “most profitable” is “most often profitable.”

### What Genres should Microsoft Studios focus on?
If we examine the median profits of each individual genre, we see that animation and adventure have the highest two median profits, by considerable margins. We found that the top two most consistently profitable genres below animation are adventure and fantasy movies. Moreover, we discovered animation is consistently profitable with 83% of films produced under this category yielding profits.

### Top 6 Grossing Studios: 2008 - 2018
In terms of revenue, it may not necessarily be productive for Microsft to focus its efforts domestically. The data in this section shows that worldwide gross earnings represent a larger portion of total gross in most instances.
Microsoft should target international markets to capture the greatest revenue generating potential, while also leveraging its global influence to create a dominant brand name in the film industry.

### When should we release the movies?

These findings suggest that big-budget movies are generally released in the summer and also leading up to the holidays, while mid-budget movies avoid the summer and low-budget movies avoid the holidays.

## Conclusion
This analysis leads to three recommendations for entering the film studios industry:
1. Focus on big-budget tent-pole releases: they make more money, and they make it more often.
2. Open or acquire an animation arm for the studio. Focus on the same genres as the mainline studio: Adventure and Fantasy.
3. Always consider the international market and audience; they will generate the vast majority of your profits.
